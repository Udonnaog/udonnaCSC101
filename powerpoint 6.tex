\section{HISTORY OF C} The interesting thing about the history of the C programming language is how it came about. The programming language was created as a means of system implementation for the UNIX operating system.
So before the C programming language came into play Dennis Ritchie and his colleague Ken Thompson wanted to develop a programming language to make utilities for the new UNIX platform so they modified the BCPL system language and then came the development of B programming language.
