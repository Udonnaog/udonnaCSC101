	\section{HISTORY AND THE FOUNDER}
	BASIC was developed by Dartmouth mathematicians JOHN GEORGE KEMENY and TOM KURTZ.
	It was also released at Dartmouth college in the year 1964.
	In the 1960s JOHN KEMENY and TOM KURTZ came to a conclusion that the students should have knowledge on programming.
	SO the two set out and began with two past languages, DOPE (DARTMOUTH OVERSIMPLIFIED PROGRAMMING EXPERIMENT) and DARSIMCO( DARTMOUTH SIMPLIFIED CODE).
	THEY LATER CONCLUDED that these languages were quite complex for the students and for what they wanted and that was due to the fact they were using FORTAN and ALGOL (programming languages with odd commands) to develop their own languages.
	SO later on JOHN KEMENY wrote the very first version of BASIC and this time FORTRAN II was used.
	LATER on the dynamic duo decided for it to be free of charge to all.
