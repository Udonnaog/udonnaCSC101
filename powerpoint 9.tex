\section{THE FOUNDER}
PYTHON was developed by Guido van Rossum also referred to as Benevolent Dictator for Life in the late 1980s but unfortunately Guido van Rossum officially stepped down from the role of lead developer on the 12th of July 2018 and later in January 2019 python core developers elected new developers to head the project.
